# NLTK-based-Model-for-Sentiment-Analysis-of-News-Headlines
This project involved the creation of a sentiment prediction model for news headlines using the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk). The goal was to determine whether the sentiments expressed in the headlines were positive or negative.

To achieve this, the project employed a combination of natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The nltk library was used to tokenize the text, remove stop words, and perform lemmatization. Then, the resulting text data was fed into a machine learning model that was trained on a labeled dataset of news headlines with positive and negative sentiments.

The resulting model is able to accurately predict whether a given news headline expresses positive or negative sentiment. This can be useful for a variety of applications, such as analyzing public opinion about a particular topic, monitoring brand reputation, or detecting trends in news sentiment.

The project also provides a useful example of how natural language processing and machine learning can be used to analyze text data and extract meaningful insights. The code and resources used in the project are available on GitHub for others to use and build upon.
